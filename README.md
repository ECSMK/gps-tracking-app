# GpsTracker
This android aplication was created to provide a standalone gps tracking solution without any third party cloud service.
As of now the gps locations are sent via email.
The app only does the tracking part, to visualize, process the gps tracks, you can implement something like Csongor Varga created using Node-Red.
You can find his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywljyO74MjE


To keep the app running in the background you probably have to set some settings on your android device, check out this website for more details: https://dontkillmyapp.com/
